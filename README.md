An easy to use oop implementation of cv2 template matching in python for automation geared towards lowering the overhead used to speed up template matching on multiple images at a time.
  
  <B1>Goals:</B1>
  
  1. To create an easy way to use cv2 template matching that also uses oop to lower the overhead usedin batch image searches.
  2. To use modern python 3.8 features to have clean and modern code.
  3. To follow the minimalist ideology of being the bare bone basics needed to lower on bloat.
  4. To have pre compiled cpython binaries for fast and easy deployment.
